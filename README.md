# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using advanced clustering techniques. The project explores three distinct machine learning approaches to segment customers: K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and GMM enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques including SHAP and LIME.

## Models and Performance

### 1. K-Means Clustering
* Number of Clusters: [K]
* Silhouette Score: [K-Means Silhouette Score]
* Key Insights: 
  - [Brief description of K-Means clustering results]

### 2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
* Number of Components: [GMM Components]
* Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): [GMM BIC Score]
* Key Insights:
  - [Brief description of GMM clustering results]

### 3. GMM with Explainable AI
* XAI Techniques: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
* Cluster Interpretability Metrics: 
  - [XAI Interpretability Metrics]
* Key Insights:
  - [Explanation of model interpretability and key findings]
